\item{plab}{Numeric value of -log10(p) above which points will be labeled.}

\item{return}{A string indicating whether to return a "graph" or "data".}

\item{colours}{A character vector of length 3 containing colours to fill negative, small, and positive fold-change values.}
}
\value{
See parameter return.
